GoPro joiner python script
======
**gopro_joiner** is a script to combine, rename and compress gopro videos. It is just something I hacked together because the file naming convention from GoPro is quite messed up.
The script will also run ffmpeg on the files to combine the videos to compress them. Just edit the joiner.py script and run it.

```
$ ./joiner path/to/video_folder
$
```
